OpenNeuro curator note: This dataset was previously accessible at ds001985. The dataset was reuploaded due to privacy considerations. 

The experiment is composed by two runs
We here report the code triggers for each run:

Run 1: single item
10 = single numbers
15 = single letters
20 & 25 = single false fonts

Run 2: strings
35 = strings numbers
40 = strings letters
45 & 50 = strings false fonts

raw files could be split into two files 
(e.g., run-1 + run-11)
